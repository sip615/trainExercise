# Train Exercise

The train exercise for the Junior Developer interview, provided by John.

## Getting Started

Download the repository to your machine. Open the index.html page in your favorite web browser (preferably one that has a developer console). Then use the developer console to see the magic.

Results have been logged to the console to demonstrate the functionality of the Train and TrainCar classes.

### Prerequisites

You must be using a browser with ES6 compatibility.

```
Chrome, Firefox
```

### Installing

It will look like you need to install node in order to run this project, but that's just the environment I set up at the beginning. I was going to go in a different direction with this, and then decided to simplify it at the last minute for the sake of time.

The code is commented to help show you how it works and what is expected to be logged to the console.

## Deployment

Ended up writing it all front-end, and there's no deployment required.
