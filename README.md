# Train Exercise

The train exercise for the Junior Developer interview, provided by John.

I wrote this project in JavaScript because it's the OOP language that I'm most well-versed in. The code contains two classes for part 1, and a third child-class for part 2, which is a child of the TrainCar class from part 1. To demonstrate, I created several instances of each class in part 1.

I originally started with each class in a separate file, and then decided to put all of the code in the same file because it was easier to work with for demonstrative purposes.

## Getting Started

Download the repository to your local directory. Open the index.html file in your favorite web browser (preferably one that has a good developer console). Then use the developer console to see the magic happening behind the scenes.

Results have been logged to the console to demonstrate the functionality of the Train and TrainCar classes.

### Prerequisites

You must be using a browser with ES6 compatibility.

```
Chrome, Firefox, etc.
```

### Installing

No installations required, unless you don't have an ES6 compatible browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

The code is commented to help show you how it works and what is expected to be logged to the console.

## Deployment

Ended up writing it all front-end, and there's no deployment required.
